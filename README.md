# Hitch-a-Ride

## A carpooling app that saves you time and money!

Ski canyons are struggling with a huge influx of congestion. Resorts are capitalizing on this by charging for parking. UDOT is working out the details for a $500M gondola. Neither of these "fixes" help the skiers.

Hitch-a-Ride is an app designed to help people link up with other users along their route to and from the mountain. This helps everybody save money on gas and parking, all while taking cars out of the canyon.

## How it works:

Verified drivers submit the drives they will going on with estimated times.

Riders search through drives for one that fits their needs, and then send a request.

Drivers can vet the requests and accept/reject certain riders.

Once a rider is accepted, a message channel will be opened up for them to work out the details.

## Bonus Features:

An SOS feature will be activated once a ride is started. This allows the user (rider or driver) to quickly call out for help if something seems amiss.

Ratings: drivers and riders will each earn a rating to help other users feel more comfortable linking up.

Maps: Once a ride is started, a map with the route is pulled up so the rider can see if they go off course.
